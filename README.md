It is possible to communicate with the services in two ways:   
- Communicating with the APIs through GETs and POSTs.   
- Through a GUI where all required features were developed as well.

**Communication between services is done using kafka**

**Note**  
None of the databases are populated.   
A payment must be created before before trying to create a request.   
Payments and Refunds IDs are autogenerated whereby the ones in the Postman collections must be changed before sending the requests.
